The background for this game is 16 people trapped on an island and mysterious murders happened. In order to survive, they have to find out who's the murderer.\r\n\r\nIn this 2-players game, one player act as the detective and the other act as the criminal. The criminal has 4 accomplices chosen among the 16 pieces, and his goal is to use these accomplices to kill all the other pieces. The goal for the detective is obviously to figure out which pieces are accomplices of the murderer. The detective can move all the pieces according to his will. The criminal however has the ability to divide the chessboard into separate \"Rooms\". A murder happens when there're more murderers than innocent people in one room. A good detective can find out lots of clues by investigating the condition of murders happened. That's how the detective gather information and eventually comes up with a deduction.\r\n\r\nThis game is well-balanced, it's challenging for both players. A serious game would easily take more than a hour. And compare with other detective games, this one successfully introduced real logic into it. There's no guessing or using intuition, you can always fined an answer by deploying rigorous reasoning. If you're a detective story fan, you should definitely try it, it's a nice workout for your brain.\r\n###To play the demo: \r\nDownload the .rar and unzip.\r\n\r\n+ Left_Click to Select.\r\n+ Hold Mouse_Right_Button and drag to Rotate the board.\r\n+ For detail rules, please read How_To_Play.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nDownload the project folder and open with Unity.(Require Unity 5.2.2 or higher)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nMain Programmer, Designer: Dun Mao\r\n\r\nAssistant Designer: Z, ZY\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
