<p>This is the first game I've ever made on Unity, it's a chess-like board inspired by one of my favourite detective story called " When They Cry". The background for this game is 16 people trapped on an island and mysterious murders happened. In order to survive, they have to find out who's the murderer.</p>

<p>In this 2-players game, one player act as the detective and the other act as the criminal. The criminal has 4 accomplices chosen among the 16 pieces, and his goal is to use these accomplices to kill all the other pieces. The goal for the detective is obviously to figure out which pieces are accomplices of the murderer. The detective can move all the pieces according to his will. The criminal however has the ability to divide the chessboard into separate "Rooms". A murder happens when there're more murderers than innocent people in one room. A good detective can find out lots of clues by investigating the condition of murders happened. That's how the detective gather information and eventually comes up with a deduction.</p>

<p>This game is well-balanced, it's challenging for both players. A serious game would easily take more than a hour. And compare with other detective games, this one successfully introduced real logic into it. There's no guessing or using intuition, you can always fined an answer by deploying rigorous reasoning. If you're a detective story fan, you should definitely try it, it's a nice workout for your brain.</p>
